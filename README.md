Simple 2D relative gravity simulation of planetary orbits using simple data structures and shared pointers.
Gravity physics are calculated with:

-Newton's law of universal gravitation asserts that the strength of the gravitational force between two particles is given by the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them, scaled by the gravitational constant G, which is 6.67 Ã— 10-11 N m2 / kg2. The pull of one particle towards another acts on the line between them.

-Net force. The principle of superposition says that the net force acting on a particle in the x or y direction is the sum of the pairwise forces acting on the particle in that direction.
  
-Acceleration. Newton's second law of motion postulates that the accelerations in the x and y directions are given by: ax = Fx / m, ay = Fy / m.
